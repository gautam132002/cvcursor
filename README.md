# CVCURSOR

cvcursor is a Python-based computer vision project that allows you to control your mouse using right-hand gestures. By waving your hand in front of the camera, the program captures and detects your hand, enabling you to move the cursor and perform various actions, such as clicking, scrolling, toggling, copy-pasting, etc., all through hand gestures.

## Supported Gestures and Corresponding Actions

cvcursor supports the following gestures and their respective actions:

- **Left Click**: Put together your index finger and thumb.
- **Right Click**: Fold your middle finger.
- **Scroll Down**: Fold your index finger.
- **Scroll Up**: Fold your ring finger.
- **Toggle**: Fold your pinky.
- **Double Click**: Quickly perform the single left-click gesture twice.

## Usage

To use cvcursor, follow the steps below:

1. Activate the virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   ```bash
   source bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` script to start the application.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Ensure that your computer has a webcam or an external camera connected, as cvcursor relies on the camera feed to detect hand gestures and control the mouse cursor.
